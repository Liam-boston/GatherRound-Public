* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**

You can download and install them from the provided links.

### Install Dependencies
Before running the server or client, you'll need to install the required dependencies for each:
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. In the root directory of the project, open a terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command to install dependencies for both the server and client:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` files for both the server and client.

### Running the Server
1. Open a new terminal instance in **Visual Studio Code** and navigate to the `/server` directory.
2. Run the following command to start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

3. Once the server is running, open a browser and go to http://localhost:9000/test to verify everything is working.

### Running the Client
1. Open a new terminal instance in **Visual Studio Code** and navigate to the `/client` directory.
2. Run the following command to install client-side dependencies (if you haven't done so already):

```shell
npm install
```

3. Then, start the client by running:

```shell
npm start
```

4. Once the client is up and running, open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
